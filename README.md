# Bank-account-simulation-
"A Java-based bank account simulation with deposit, withdraw, balance check, and transaction history features. Utilizes OOP principles to ensure secure and efficient account management, providing a realistic banking experience."
*Bank Account Simulation in Java *

- Users can deposit money into their account.
- Users can withdraw money from their account, with a check for sufficient balance.
-  Users can view their current account balance.
-  Users can view their transaction history.

*How it Works:*

1. The `Account` class represents a bank account with attributes like account number, account holder's name, balance, and transaction history.
2. The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods update the balance and add transactions to the history.
3. The `displayBalance` and `displayTransactionHistory` methods provide the current balance and transaction history.
4. The `BankAccountSimulation` class provides a simple text-based interface for users to interact with their account.
